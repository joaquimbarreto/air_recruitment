This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## The Task

The aim of this exercise is to create an interactive chart app using React, the kind of chart which may be seen in a data driven SAAS dashboard.

Using the data below, you should render a single donut chart that displays "Table 1" by default and has the option to combine the extra information in "Table 2" (default only Table 1 data, toggle shows combined data, no need for Table 2 data on its own).

Table 1:

p | 5

ne | 2

nu | 2

na | 1

Table 2:

p | 6

ne | 2

nu | 1

na | 1

Features and requirements

When a user selects a legend element, the corresponding section on the graph should in some way 'highlight'.
Design should be modern and polished.
Must be built using valid HTML, CSS and JavaScript.
Work to be hosted on owned GIT repository and running version of app made available online.

## Server

To start server: json-server --watch data.json --port 3001

To start app: yarn start or try just 'yarn' and then 'yarn start'

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br>
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br>
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br>
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br>
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br>
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (Webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
